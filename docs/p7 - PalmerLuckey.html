        Luckey was born and raised in Long Beach, California, with three younger sisters.[5] His father worked at a car dealership.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a child he was homeschooled by his mother, took sailing lessons, and had an intense interest in electronics
        and engineering. He took community college courses at Golden West College and Long Beach City College
        beginning at the age of 14 or 15, and started attending courses at California State University,
        Long Beach in 2010. He wrote and served as Online Editor for the university's student-run newspaper, Daily 49er.
    </p>
    <p>
        During his childhood and teenage years, he experimented with a variety of complex electronics projects including coilguns, Tesla
        coils, and lasers. He built a PC gaming "rig" costing tens of thousands of U.S. dollars with an elaborate six-monitor setup.
    </p>
    <p>
        He had an intense interest in virtual reality (VR), and built an extensive private collection of over 50
        different head-mounted displays. To fund these projects, he earned at least US$36,000 by
        fixing and reselling damaged iPhones and working part-time as a groundskeeper, youth sailing coach, and computer repair technician.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2009, he founded the ModRetro Forums with a friend, creating an online community for "portabilization", a hobby that revolves
        around turning old hardware devices such as game consoles and PCs into self-contained portable units mixing new and old technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        He later attended California State University, Long Beach, where he majored in journalism. During his time there,
        he worked as a part-time engineer at the Mixed Reality Lab (MxR) at the Institute for Creative Technologies
        (ICT) at the University of Southern California as part of a design team for cost-effective virtual reality.
